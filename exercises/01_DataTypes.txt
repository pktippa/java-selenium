Where num03, num04, num05 should occupy minimum memory space. Print the value of num05

Decimals

* Creat a variable with name 'num06' which can store 544.12, add 75 (int) to it and print the output.

2. Boolean

* Create a variable with name 'bool01' which stores value of true, Calculate negation (opposite) of bool01 and print that value
* Create two variables with names 'bool02', 'bool03' with values as true and false. Add them both and print the result,
Note: Dont use third variable.

3. Characters

* Print Sigma symbol Î£, by defining a variable name char01 and assigning a unicode character value(not the one shown here)
to it.
* Create a String variable with name 'fname' value as "Bhavani", take another char variable 'lname' with value 'T'
(observe 'T' is in single quotes, it should be char datatype). Print a variable 'fullname' (you have to find the datatype)
whose value should be computed with variables 'fname' and 'lname' and the value should be "Bhavani T" (note there is a space
between them)
