1. Numbers

Whole Numbers

* Create a variable with name 'num01' which stores number value of 152 and should have occupy minimum memory space.
Hint: Recollect how much spacy allocates for each data type and what is their value storage range. 
Ex: byte 8 bits ; range -128 to 127
* Create two variables num03, num04 with values 32500, 25612, now add these two and keep value in third variable num05.
Where num03, num04, num05 should occupy minimum memory space. Print the value of num05.
Hint: Same as above question

Decimals

* Create a variable with name 'num06' which can store 544.12, Create another variable with 'short' datatype
with name 'num07' with value of 15 to it, Now create a new variable (you have to find the datatype) with name 'num08' 
which is sum of 'num06', 'num07' and print the value of 'num08'
Hint: Recollect what data types can store decimal values.

2. Boolean

* Create a variable with name 'bool01' which stores value of true, Calculate negation (opposite) of bool01 and print that value
Hint: Google how to calculate negation of a boolean variable in java.
* Create two variables with names 'bool02', 'bool03' with values as true and false. Add them both and print the result,
Note: Dont use third variable.

3. Characters

* Print Sigma symbol Î£, by defining a variable name char01 and assigning a unicode character value(not the one shown here)
to it.
Hint: Google and find out the unicode character of Sigma symbol.
* Create a String variable with name 'fname' value as "Bhavani", take another char variable 'lname' with value 'T'
(observe 'T' is in single quotes, it should be char datatype). Print a variable 'fullname' (you have to find the datatype)
whose value should be computed with variables 'fname' and 'lname' and the value should be "Bhavani T" (note there is a space
between them).
