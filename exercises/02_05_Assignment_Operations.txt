Assignment Operations

Arthimetic Assigment Operators
5.1 =
5.2 +=

Create a variable with name "var_asgn_p" with value 10, Now use += operator such that it 
value becomes 14.

5.2 -=

You have to find the inital value of variable "var_asgn_n" , such that 
if now use -= operator as, var_asgn_n -= var_asgn_p; the resulted var_asgn_n value should be 6.

5.3 *= 

You have to find the inital value of variable "var_asgn_m" , such that 
if now use *= operator as, var_asgn_m *= 3; the resulted var_asgn_m value should be 18.

5.4 /= Divison Assignment operator

You have to find the inital value of variable "var_asgn_d" , such that 
if now use /= operator as, var_asgn_d /= 3; the resulted var_asgn_d value should be 3.


5.4 %= Reminder Assignment operator

You have to find the inital value of variable "var_asgn_r" , such that 
if now use %= operator as, var_asgn_r %= 3; the resulted var_asgn_r value should be 1.
