4. Logical Operators

4.1 Logical And Operator &&

Recap:

true && true => true
true && false => false
false && true => false
false && false => false

a)

Create two variables "var_num" with 25, "var_num2" with 30, Create another variable "check_num" 
with 28. Check if "check_num" is greater than "var_num" and less than "var_num2", capture the
resulted value in "res_log_and" and print the same.(Hint: You need to perform relational operations)

b)

For the same expression above you built, change the value of "var_num2" such that the whole expression 
should return false. (Hint: comparison of "check_num" and "var_num2" for less than should return false).
 Print the value of "var_num2" and also the expression result.

c) 

Revert back the "var_num2" value to 30 and use the same expression above, now change the value of
"var_num" such that the expression should result in false. Print the value of "var_num" and also the
expression result.

d)

Combine expression results of 4.1 b) and 4.1 c) ( you calculated above) with logical and && and print the result.


4.2 Logical Or ||

Recap

true || true => true
true || false => true
false || true => true
false || false => false

a)

Create three variables "var_num_1", "var_num_2", "var_num_3" such that you have to find the values of
these three variables.

Using Relational Operations >, < between these three variables, you have to complete the four operations
defined for Logical Or || in above truth table.(Ex: (4 > 5) || (4 < 3) )
